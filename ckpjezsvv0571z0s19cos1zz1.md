Then make one ``.html`` file and another ``.css`` file. and the link it using 
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="file name"
```
So after linking that, I started coding in CSS file.
I started making the background using 5 colors, the added border, size and finally the initials.

This is the CSS code:
