## My journey of ðŸ’¯ days at Hashnode

Hey Guys!
This is not a technical blog. This is my 100 days of journey at  [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/).
On 25th January 2021, I joined Hashnode to start my technical blogging journey. I posted my[ first article ](https://saiansul.hashnode.dev/your-home-wifi-lan-wan-or-pan)on 31st January 2021. Till now I have written 16 articles in these 100 days.

After I joined I got a greeting mail from @[Sandeep Panda](@sandeep) giving a warm welcome and helping me to start using Hashnode.
Thanks for helping me out!

Since I wanted some feedback for the articles I actually got a great response from this platform. I also got some reactions from the Hashnode team. For letting me know the improvements. 
Thanks @[Edidiong Asikpo](@didicodes)and @[Eleftheria Batsou](@eleftheriabatsou)for reacting to my post and encouraging my efforts.
