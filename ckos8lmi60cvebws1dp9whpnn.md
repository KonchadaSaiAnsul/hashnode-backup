Hey Guys!
Welcome back to another brand new post of ** Sai Ansul's Blog**.
Today we are gonna find out ** How to watch a YouTube video using python with just  2 lines of code** , yes you heard it right just 2 lines of code.

So the process of this is also similar, though sharing the part 1 and 2.

The process is also divided in 3 parts that are:
- Creating a project
- Installing ``pywhatkit``
- 2 lines of code


# Part 1

First of all you need to a python interpreter for this project in your device.


I have here used **pycharm** by **JetBrains**, you can use any other also.

Then you have to name the file.
I have named it as   ``` YouTube ```.

Then press create, after that a page would open.

 Then select the whole over there with ```Ctrl+A``` and click on ```Backspace```.
So now you have a empty slate open just like the below image.

# Part 2
Then you need to go to your Browser and search for  [```pywhatkit```.](https://pypi.org/project/pywhatkit/)

Then after you open the site, you'll see a interface like this,

Then you need to click on ```pip install pywhatkit``` to copy the code.

Then we again need to go to the project created.
And open ```Terminal``` and paste this.

And when it shows the message as shown in the image, then we are good to start.

Now lets proceed towards the part 3 that is to code

Now first we need to write
```
import pywhatkit
```
After that you need to write
```
pywhatkit.playonyt('Say hello to hashnode sponsors')
```
Inside the bracket you need to write the name of the video,

And in just 5 seconds the video opens and it starts to play.

You can check the results out below.
